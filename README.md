INTRODUCTION
------------

Stock price prediction has always been a challenging task because of the volatility in the stock market. 
In this project, we will use a deep learning(DL)-based method to predict stock market prices for a certain period. The method consists of a dedicated architecture of a stacked multilayer Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) with attention mechanism.
